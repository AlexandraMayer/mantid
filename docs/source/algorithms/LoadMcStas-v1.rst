Description
-----------

Reads a McStas Nexus file into a Mantid WorkspaceGroup with a 
user-supplied name. Data generated by McStas monitor components are 
stored in workspaces of type Workspace2D or Event.

For further information about Mcstas and Mantid see `here <https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/McStas-and-Mantid>`_.
This includes how to generate a McStas 2.1 eventa data file and the corresponding IDF.
It also includes McStas event data conventions.
The information in the link is *work in progress*.

LoadMcStas replaces LoadMcStasEventNexus. LoadMcStas can be used for 
reading McStas 2.1 histogram and event data. 
:ref:`algm-LoadMcStasNexus` can be used 
for reading McStas 2.0 histogram data.
