Description
-----------

Moves the instrument and then corrects the flight paths such that a flat detector appears spherical with a constant l2 value.

Both time-of-flight sample-detector time and sample to detector distance are corrected to constant values.

The sample to detector distance must be specified as **l2** in the instrument parameters file.

So far this has only be tested on the ILL IN5 instrument.
