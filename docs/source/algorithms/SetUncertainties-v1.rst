-----------

The uncertainties for the entire workspace will be recalculated according to the ``SetError`` property.

- ``SetError="zero"`` will change all of the uncertainties to zero
- ``SetError="sqrt"`` will recalculate all of the uncertainties to be the square root of the y value
- ``SetError="oneifzero"`` will change the uncertainties to one if they are currently zero
