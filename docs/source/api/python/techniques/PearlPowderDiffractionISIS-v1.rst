Pearl Powder Diffraction
========================

Description
-----------
A wide variety of algorithms are available within Mantid for processing of data,
writing results files, etc.  These may be run interactively, one at a time, but
in general scripting (using the Python scripting language) enables a series of
algorithms to be called in a specific order to carry out more complex tasks, such
as data normalisation and writing data files suitable for input to Rietveld
refinement programmes (GSAS, FullProf, etc).

The script used to process Pearl data have been integrated to Mantid
which can be found inside the following directory on a Windows machine:
`C:\\MantidInstall\\scripts\\PearlPowderISIS`.
