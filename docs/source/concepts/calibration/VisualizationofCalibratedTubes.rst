.. _Visualization_of_Calibrated_Tubes:

When viewing the instrument in `Instrument View <Instrument_View>`__
note that for instruments that uses the 3D-graphics accellerator option
'outline' in `IDF <IDF>`__, you will not see the effects of calibration
in a 3D view. To see the calibration, select a 2D view. Cyclindrical Y
is appropriate for MERLIN and WISH.
