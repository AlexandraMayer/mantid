Crystal Improvements
--------------------

- :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels>` has parameter errors reduced, option for simplex minimization,
  and 3 new workspaces which can plot calculated vs theoretical columns, rows, and TOF for each bank.
- 5 detectors added to the MANDI instrument geometry

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

- Vanadium Curves and Ceria Peaks graphs are plotted once basic and cropped calibration process has been carried out
- Customise Bank Name text-field will set the workspace and .his file name according to this Bank Name
  provided by the user for Cropped Calibration
