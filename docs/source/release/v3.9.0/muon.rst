Muon Analysis
#############


- Fixed a bug where the "load next/previous" buttons appended runs in certain cases where this was not the intended behaviour.
- The *Grouping Options* and *Data Analysis* tabs now only become enabled once data has been loaded on the *Home* tab. Data should first be loaded on the *Home* tab, then it can be grouped/fitted. After the first dataset has been loaded, additional datasets can of course be added (for a multi-dataset fit) using the *Data Analysis* tab.
