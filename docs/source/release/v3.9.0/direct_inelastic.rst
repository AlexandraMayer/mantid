Improvements
------------

- New algorithm :ref:`CalcCountRate <algm-CalcCountRate>` allows to calculate instrument counting rate as function of the experiment 
  time to be able to filter spurions, which may sometimes appear on ISIS instruments. It can also be used to evaluate changes
  of sample reflectivity as function of some slow changing experiment's parameter e.g. temperature, magnetic field or pressure.
