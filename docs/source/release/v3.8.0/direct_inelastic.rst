Improvements
------------

- :ref:`MDNormDirectSC <algm-MDNormDirectSC>` has an option to skip safety checks. This improves the speed when acting on workspace groups.

- A qtiGenie method *export_masks* was brought to Mantid as :ref:`ExportSpectraMask <algm-ExportSpectraMask>` Python algorithm and got documentation, unit tests and Python GUI.
  The algorithm allows to export list of masked workspace spectra and save these spectra as ISIS *.msk* file. 
  The export mask procedure is often used by instrument scientists in ISIS, and they had to initialize qtiGenie to do this operation before these changes. 

- :ref:`GetEiMonDet <algm-GetEiMonDet>` has had a complete rewrite. The new version 2 utilizes elastic peak position data generated by :ref:`FindEPP <algm-FindEPP>`, the detectors of interest are specified by their indices instead of distances from sample, and the revised algorithm is able to deal with cases where neutrons arrive at the detectors in a later time frame.
- :ref:`MaskDetectors <algm-MaskDetectors>` modified to work on a grouped workspace, so if a spectra of the mask workspace is masked, the 
 spectra of the target workspace, with the detector group containing the masked detector become masked. This allows to use *.xml* masks, prodiced by 
 :ref:`SaveMask <algm-SaveMask>` algorithm on the grouped workspaces, obtained from ISIS instruments.  
 
- :ref:`LoadMask <algm-LoadMask>` modified to accept a workspace-source of spectra-detector map when spectra mask is provided.
  This allow users to use old legacy *.msk* files as source of mask workspaces usable with modified :ref:`MaskDetectors <algm-MaskDetectors>` algorithm
  and to use old spectra masks on a workspaces with different grouping and spectra-detector maps.

- There is a new algorithm :ref:`MagFormFactorCorrection <algm-MagFormFactorCorrection>` which will scale an input workspace by 1/:math:`|F(Q)|^2` where :math:`F(Q)` is the magnetic form factor for a specified magnetic ion.

PyChop
------

- :ref:`PyChop <PyChop>` has been fixed and updated with a new Python commandline interface and a new GUI. Flux and resolution calculations for LET are now fully integrated into a single interface, and there is also support for calculating the resolution, flux and allowed :math:`E_i` in multi-rep mode.


Crystal Field
-------------

- A fitting function was added (:ref:`CrystalFieldMultiSpectrum <func-CrystalFieldMultiSpectrum>`) that fits crystal field parameters to multiple spectra simultaneously.
