The [developer documentation](http://www.mantidproject.org/Category:Development) has information on how to participate in the mantid project as a developer. This document is meant to outline the steps for contributing to mantid without becomming a developer.

 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Make changes as you see fit. Please still follow the guidelines for [running the unit tests](http://www.mantidproject.org/Running_the_unit_tests) and the [build servers](http://www.mantidproject.org/The_automated_build_process).
 3. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull requests work best if you do your work on a branch rather than in the master.
 4. Email mantid-help@mantidproject.org as an extra poke to get people to notice your change. The mantid project does not use pull requests internally so the extra notification makes sure that people notice the request.
