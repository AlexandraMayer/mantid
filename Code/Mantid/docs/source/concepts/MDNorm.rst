.. _MDNorm:

Multi dimensional neutron scattering data normalization
=======================================================

In any experiment, a measurement consists of a raw quantity of interest and
a statistical significance of the measurement itself. 
For neutron diffraction, the differential scattering cross section at some 
point :math:`\mathbf{Q}` in the reciprocal space, measured with a single
detector with a solid angle :math:`d \Omega`, is given by:

.. math::

    \frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=\frac{N}{\Phi \times d \Omega}
    
where :math:`N` is the number of scattered neutrons in a small volume 
:math:`d \mathbf{Q}` around :math:`\mathbf{Q}`, and :math:`\Phi` is
the time integrated incident flux that contribute to the scattering in the given
volume.
