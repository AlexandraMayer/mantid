Description
-----------

This algorithm is to import data file generated by SPICE, a 
data acquisition software used in HFIR ,
and record the data and run information to TableWorkspaces.

Format of SPICE data file
#############################################

There are two parts of content in SPICE data file. 
One is the run information, in which line that starts with #. 
The other is the experimental data.  
The first item is an integer as the index of experimental data point. 


Usage
-----

**Example - load a SPICE .dat file:**

.. testcode:: ExLoadHB2AData

  LoadSPICEAscii(Filename=r'HB2A_exp0231_scan0001.dat',
	OutputWorkspace = 'HB2A_0231_0001_Data',
	RunInfoWorkspace = 'HB2A_0231_Info')

  datatbws = mtd['HB2A_exp0231_scan0001.dat'] 
  infotablews = mtd[HB2A_0231_Info')

.. testcleanup:: ExLoadHB2AData

  DeleteWorkspace(runinfowsP
  DeleteWorkspace(datatbws)

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExLoadHB2AData
