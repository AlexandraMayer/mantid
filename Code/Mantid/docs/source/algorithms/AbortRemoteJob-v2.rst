remote compute resource. The job must have been submitted using
:ref:`algm-SubmitRemoteJob`. And jobs are always submitted within a

:ref:`algm-StartRemoteTransaction`.

service remote job submission API, see the `remote job submission API
docs <http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_Job_Submission_API>`_.
