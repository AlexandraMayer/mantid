/**
*  This class is used to find the nearest neighbours of a detector in the instrument
*  geometry. This class can be queried through calls to the getNeighbours() function
*  on a Detector object.
*
*  This class uses the ANN Library, from David M Mount and Sunil Arya which is incorporated
*  into Mantid's Kernel module. Mantid uses version 1.1.2 of this library.
*  ANN is available from <http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/> and is released under the GNU LGPL.
*  
*  Known potential issue: boost's graph has an issue that may cause compilation errors in some
*  circumstances in the current version of boost used by Mantid (1.43) based on tr1::tie. This
*  issue is fixed in later versions of boost, but should in theory be guarded against by this
*  file only being included in ParameterMap.
