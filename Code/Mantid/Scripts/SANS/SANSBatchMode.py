# M. Gigg - Based on Steve King's example

#
# For batch-reduction of LOQ or SANS2D runs in Mantid using a SINGLE set of instrument parameters (Q, wavelength, radius, etc)
#
# Reads multi-line input from file of the form:
# sample_sans   54431   sample_trans    54435   direct_beam 54433   can_sans    54432   can_trans   54434   direct_beam 54433   background_sans     background_trans        direct_beam     output_as   script54435.txt
#
# Assumes the following have already been set by either the SANS GUI or directly from python using the AssignSample, LimitsR etc commands
# instrument
# data directory
# data format
# user file directory
# user file name
# reduction type
# detector bank
# whether to use default wavelength range for transmissions

# Allows over-riding of following from user (mask) file:
# radial integration limits
# wavelength limits, bin size and binning
# q limits, q bin size and binning
# qxy limits, qxy bin size and binning

# The save directory must currently be specified in the Mantid.user.properties file

#Make the reduction module available
