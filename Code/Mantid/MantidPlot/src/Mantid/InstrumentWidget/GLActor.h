  \brief  An actor class that holds geometry objects with its position.
  \author Chapon Laurent & Srikanth Nagella
  \date   August 2008
  \version 1.0

  Base class for all objects in a 3D Scene. Methods are provided to position and rotate the objects.
  The objects can also be set as active or not. Actors maintain safe pointer to a GLObject.
