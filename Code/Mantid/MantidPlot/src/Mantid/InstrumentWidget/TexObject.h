\class TexObject
\brief Class for an object with a texture
\version 1.0
\date 05 Oct 2010
\author Roman Tolchenov, Tessella plc

This class shows a bank of detectors as a single object. Individual detectors are shown by different colours 
on the texture. The shape of a TexObject can be either a cylinder or a cuboid and the detectors must lie on
a straight line. This class handles the texture creation and rendering. The derived classes TexCylinder and 
TexCuboid handle the shape drawing.
