/** This is an interface to a fitting function - a semi-abstarct class.
    Functions derived from IFunctionMW can be used with the Fit algorithm.
    IFunctionMW defines the structure of a fitting funtion.

    A function has a number of named parameters (not arguments), type double, on which it depends.
    Parameters must be declared either in the constructor or in the init() method
    of a derived class with method declareParameter(...). Method nParams() returns 
    the number of declared parameters. A parameter can be accessed either by its name
    or the index. For example in case of Gaussian the parameters can be "Height",
    "PeakCentre" and "Sigma".

    To fit a function to a set of data its parameters must be adjusted so that the difference
    between the data and the corresponding function values were minimized. This is the aim
    of the Fit algorithm. But Fit does not work with the declared parameters directly.
    Instead it uses other - active - parameters. The active parameters can be a subset of the
    declared parameters or completely different ones. The rationale for this is following.
    The fitting parameters sometimes need to be fixed during the fit or "tied" (expressed
    in terms of other parameters). In this case the active parameters will be those
    declared parameters which are not tied in any sence. Also some of the declared parameters
    can be unsuitable for the use in a fitting algorithm. In this case different active parameters
    can be used in place of the inefficient declared parameters. An example is Gaussian where
    "Sigma" makes the fit unstable. So in the fit it can be replaced with variable Weight = 1 / Sigma
    which is more efficient. The number of active parameters (returned by nActive()) cannot be
    greater than nParams(). The function which connects the active parameters with the declared ones
    must be monotonic so that the forward and backward transformations between the two sets are
    single-valued (this is my understanding). At the moment only simple one to one transformations
    of Weight - Sigma type are allowed. More complecated cases of simultaneous transformations of
    several parameters are not supported.

    The active parameters can be accessed by their index. The implementations of the access method
    for both active and declared parameters must ensure that any changes to one of them 
    immediately reflected on the other so that the two are consistent at any moment.

    IFunctionMW declares method nameOfActive(size_t i) which returns the name of the declared parameter
    corresponding to the i-th active parameter. I am not completely sure in the usefulness of it.

    IFunctionMW provides methods for tying and untying parameters. Only the declared parameters can be 
    tied. A tied parameter cannot be active. When a parameter is tied it becomes inactive.
    This implies that the number of active parameters is variable and can change at runtime.

    Method addConstraint adds constraints on possible values of a declared parameter. Constraints
    and ties are used only in fitting.

    The main method of IFunctionMW is called function(out,xValues,nData). It calculates nData output values
    out[i] at arguments xValues[i]. Implement functionDeriv method for the function to be used with
    fitting algorithms using derivatives. functionDeriv calculates patrial derivatives of the
    function with respect to the fitting parameters.

    Any non-fitting parameters can be implemented as attributes (class IFunctionMW::Attribute). 
    An attribute can have one of three types: std::string, int, or double. The type is set at construction
    and cannot be changed later. To read or write the attributes there are two ways. If the type
    is known the type specific accessors can be used, e.g. asString(), asInt(). Otherwise the
    IFunctionMW::AttributeVisitor can be used. It provides alternative virtual methods to access 
    attributes of each type. When creating a function from a string (using FunctionFactory::creaeInitialized(...))
    the attributes must be set first, before any fitting parameter, as the number and names of the parameters
    can depend on the attributes.
