    /** 
    Base class for data file loading algorithms.This class provides interface for 
    data file loading algorithms to quickly check the file type by opening it and 
    reading the first 100 bytes /extension of the file. It also provides an interface to 
    check how much it can load the file by reading the first few lines of the file.
