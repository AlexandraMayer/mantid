/** Class to support memory managment operations performed over arrays of MDDataPoints, which are represented as an arrays of bytes here
    The array of MDDataPoints is arranged in memory according to MDImage, namely:
	Every image cell has correspondent block of pixels; The pixels for cell N are located after all pixels contributed to cells with i<N and the size of the block
	equal to the value necessary to place MD_image_point[N].npix pixels which contribute to the cell N;
