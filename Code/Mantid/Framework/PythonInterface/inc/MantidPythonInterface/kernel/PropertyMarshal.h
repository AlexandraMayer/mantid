     * Boost.Python is able to declare several 'overloaded' functions of the
     * same name but if the number of arguments are the same and only the
     * types differ it is not able to figure out the correct function to
     * call. It instead chooses the last from the exported list that contains
     * a type that the value can be converted to. This then raises an exception
     * in Mantid.
     *
     * The helpers declared here deal with calling the correct function depending
     * on the type passed to it.

     * We will also need marshaling for these functions as we want be able to
