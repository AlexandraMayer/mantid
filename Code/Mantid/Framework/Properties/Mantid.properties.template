# File: Mantid Properties
# Purpose: This file contains the basic configuration for Mantid.
# WARNING: This file is not intended to be edited by users.
#          If you wish to override any setting in this file
#          Simply copy the entry into the Mantid.user.Properties file
#          and set the value you desire there.  Any settings in the user.properties
#          file will override those set in this file.
#
#          This File will be overwritten with each new version of Mantid, however
#          we will never alter your user.properties file so settings there are safe.
