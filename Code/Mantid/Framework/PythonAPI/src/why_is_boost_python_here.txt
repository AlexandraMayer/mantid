The boost python source (1.43) has been included here to remedy a problem with
the boost static libraries that are shipped with the linux distributions. They
are not compiled with -fPIC, meaning that another shared library cannot be linked 
with them. The simplest solution, which also avoids having separate static libs
for Windows & OS X, is to simple include the src in the compilation. It's relatively
small and hasn't changed in quite some time. This is only required for the old API
and will disappear when this does.

More detail here as to why this is necessary here: http://trac.mantidproject.org/mantid/ticket/4204
