/** The class is the part of the VisualisationWorkspace and describes the basic multidimentional geometry of the object, 
*   e.g. the dimensions of the reciprocal space and other possible dimenions  
*   the reference reciprocal lattice, the size and shape of a primary crystall cell
*   plus number of additional ortogonal dimensions, e.g. temperature, pressure etc. 
*
*   Class provides the reference framework for visualisation and analysis operations alowing to compare different workspaces and to modify 
*   the visualisation geometry as requested by user
*
*   It is the collections of the basis vectors of extended reciprocal lattice namely, from 1 to 3 bais vectors of k-space 
*   adjacent to reciprocal lattice cell (orts of projection axes defined by u1 || a*, u2 in plane of a* and b* i.e. crystal Cartesian axes)
*   and all additional basis  vectors for orthogonal dimensions (energy transfer, temperature, etc.) 
*   In addition to that the class keeps pointer to the the unit crystal cell of the reciprocal lattice 
*   If the temperature is present among dimensions, the unit cell should depend on it?
