/** Represents a 'basis' dimension.e.g. single direction in a multidimensional workspace;
*
*   There are two kinds of dimensions in multidimensional workspace: the reciprocal lattice vectors and orthogonal dimensions, describing other independent
*   variables e.g. energy transfer or temperature;  
*
*   A reciprocal basis dimension represents single axis among projection axes defined by u1 || a*, u2 in plane of a* and b* where a* and b* are 
*   reciprocal basis vectors,
*   i.e. the crystal Cartesian axis relatied to a reciprocal unit cell (a cell of a Bravis lattice) if this direction is a reciprocal direction 
*   
* 
*
*   Orthogonal dimensions are always orthogonal to each other and to crystallographic directions, 
*   Crystallgraphic directions are also orthogonal even for a non-cubic reciprocal lattice.
*
*   Basis dimensions are those known from disk, that are in their raw unbinned form.
