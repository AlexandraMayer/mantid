/** SymmetryOperation :

    Crystallographic symmetry operations that involve rotations, (roto-)inversions
    and mirror-planes in three dimensions can be represented by 3x3 integer
    matrices.

    In this interface, each symmetry operation has an "order", which is an
    unsigned integer describing the number of times a symmetry operation
    has to be applied to an object until it is identical.

    Furthermore, each symmetry operation has a string-identifier. It contains the
    symbol of the operation and the relevant direction, i.e. direction of a rotation
    axis or direction perpendicular to a mirror plane. Examples are "2 [100]" for
    a 2-fold rotation around the x-axis or "m [001]" for a mirror plane perpendicular
    to the z-axis. For hexagonal coordinate systems the symmetry operations differ,
    so their symbols are marked with an additional "h" at the end. One example is
    "2 [100]h" which denotes a 2-fold axis in x-direction of a hexagonal coordinate
    system. The matrices and identifiers are taken from [1].

    Using the symmetry operations in code is easy. All that is required is constructing
    an instance of the desired operation and calling its templated apply-method:

        SymOpMirrorPlaneZ symOp;
        V3D mirrored = symOp.apply(V3D(1, 1, 1));

    Because the symmetry operation is using Kernel::IntMatrix internally, it can be
    used on any object for which Kernel::IntMatrix implements a multiplication-operator.

    While all the operations could be represented by just one class (SymmetryOperation)
    with the correct parameters set, having one class for each operation provides more
    semantics in the code using these operations.
