/** SymmetryOperation :

    Crystallographic symmetry operations that involve rotations, roto-inversions
    and mirror-planes in three dimensions can be represented by 3x3 integer
    matrices.

    In this interface, each symmetry operation has an "order", which is an
    unsigned integer describing the number of times a symmetry operation
    has to be applied to an object until it is identical.

    This supplies one criterion for correctness-testing. Multiplying a vector
    n times with the corresponding matrix (where n = order) must result
    in a vector that is identical to the original one.
