/** The class is the part of the VisualisationWorkspace and describes the basic multidimentional geometry of the object, 
*   e.g. the dimensions of the reciprocal space and other possible dimenions  
*   the reference reciprocal lattice, the size and shape of a primary crystall cell
*   and number of additional ortogonal dimensions, e.g. temperature, pressure etc. 
*
*   Class provides the reference framework for visualisation and analysis operations alowing to compare different workspaces and to modify 
    the visualisation geometry as requested by user.
