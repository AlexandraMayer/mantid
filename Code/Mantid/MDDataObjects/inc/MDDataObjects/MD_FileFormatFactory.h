/** The class takes the file name and returns file the reader/writer which would understand and interpret the file format 
 *  of the file, provided. If the file is not found, the factory returns the default reader or the one, modified 
 *
 *  The file reader has to satisfy IMD_FileFormat interface
 *
 * not a factory in Mantid sence, as the rules to select file format are defined within the class, so user who creates new format
 * has to add these rules to the class manualy 
 *
 * Proper Mantid factory will be build if this class widely used in a future;
