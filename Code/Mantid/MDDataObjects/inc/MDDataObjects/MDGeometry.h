/** The class describes the geometry of the N-D visualisation workspace and provides interface and convenient container to sizes and shapes of DND object
*
*   It is specific workspace geometry, which is used for visualisation and analysis. 
*   It describes current size and shape of the data and its dimensions, including the dimensions which are integrated. 
*   It changes as the result of operations as user tries to look at the reciprocal space from different points of view and selects for 
*   analysis different dimensions and different parts of the space.
