"""
    Base reduction class. Hold a list of data and a list of reduction steps to apply to them.
    
    Pseudo code example:
    
    r = Reducer()
    r.set_instrument( SANSInstrument() )
    r.append_step( ReductionStep() )
    r.reduce()
    
    The ReductionStep object is initialized before being passed to the Reducer.
    The Reducer will call ReductionStep.execute() when Reducer.reduce() is called.
    
    The ReductionStep.execute() method takes two arguments, a reference to the
    Reducer itself and the name of the workspace to apply the step to (usually a data set). 
    The Reducer object reference is passed so that the reduction step can access
    instrument settings.
