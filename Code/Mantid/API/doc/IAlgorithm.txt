=============

I anticipate taking the INamedInterface stuff, but haven't done so yet.
	- in fact, this is used for the queryInterface method of IInterface, so if I don't use
	  that I may not need this.
For now, have created empty INamedInterface & IInterface.

Conceptually, our initialize, execute & finalize methods are
the same as the sysInitialize/sysExecute/sysFinalize methods in the Gaudi version. We don't
have any 'sys' methods in our version.

We don't at present see a need for the reinitialize method in our code.
Similarly, we don't think we need any of the begin/endRun methods (they seem to relate to
events or the event loop, which we won't have).
resetExecuted is also left out.

StatusCode returns - not sure about these, seem to be something of a FORTRAN hangover and
we should perhaps be using exceptions instead. OTOH, they're everywhere and it may be more
trouble than it's worth to change from these.
For the initial version, I'm using a (very) simplified StatusCode class.

Why is the return type of the 'version' method a string?

Added a virtual destructor, which is missing from the original file.

IAlgorithm now inherits from IProperty (which inherits from INamedInterface, for now at least).
