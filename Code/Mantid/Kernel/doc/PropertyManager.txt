=============

Regarding the IProperty interface methods....

	setProperty (const Property &p)    - don't really understand the function of this method.
										 It uses the Gaudi Property assign() method.
	setProperty (const std::string &s) - this uses the output of Gaudi's Property::fillStream method where the property is 
										 represented as 'name':value. I haven't included that method at present, so
										 have left out this one as well.
										 
    setProperty (const std::string &n, const std::string &v) - Kept, but return type changed to void
    getProperty (Property *p) const  ->  renamed checkProperty
	getProperty (const std::string &name) const  - Kept
	getProperty (const std::string &n, std::string &v)  ->  renamed getPropertyValue and string value is the return type
	std::vector< Property * >& getProperties () const  - Kept

	
There's no concept of 'mandatoryness' in there yet.

The Gaudi class has 'remote properties' - I don't.

Our property manager class owns all its properties.
