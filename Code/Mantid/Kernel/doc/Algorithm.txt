=============

We have some method name changes w.r.t. the Gaudi version:
	sysInitialize -> initialize
	sysExecute    -> execute
	sysFinalize   -> finalize
	initialize    -> init
	execute       -> exec
	finalize      -> final
	
Our init, exec & final methods are protected.
One thing to note is that although Gaudi initializes and finalizes sub-algorithms in the code for
this class, it doesn't execute them anywhere. I don't know where that happens.

We're not taking a number of methods from Gaudi:
	sysReinitialize, sysBeginRun, sysEndRun, resetExecuted, beginRun, endRun
		- these are IAlgorithm methods that we didn't want
	isEnabled - don't see need for this. You'd only instantiate algorithms you definitely want.
	filterPassed/setFilterPassed - these are event loop related.
	
Not put in yet:

	Nothing relating to services has been put in yet.
	setOutputLevel is one such method (its value is retrieved from the message service).
	
	Properties.
	
	IInterface methods - addRef, release, queryInterface (not even in IInterface yet).
	
We are keeping the subalgorithm concept.

The Gaudi idea of an error count is related to having an event loop, so it's been left out.
