RJT, 13/11/07
=============

Taking the basics of this class in, but not the more complex features that Gaudi has (e.g. callbacks)

A couple of method name-changes (I figured these could be overloaded methods in the derived class):
	toString   -> value
	fromString -> setValue

Another change is that I have made the property's name const (so there's no setName method).
	
Have added the methods isValid() and isDefault(). The former is dealt with in one of the derived classes in Gaudi. (The
Gaudi structure for dealing with properties has at least four layers - some, I think, as a way of adding in functionality
after the initial development. I expect to have only 2 layers.)

At this stage, I don't see the need for a clone() method, or for a copy constructor or assignment operator, but these
can be added later if needed. Similarly, I haven't included the load() and assign() methods, or the fillStream() one.
