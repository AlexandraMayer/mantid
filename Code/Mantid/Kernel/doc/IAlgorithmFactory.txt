=============

This interface to the Algorithm Factory takes part of the functionality of the Gaudi
IAlgManager class. Basically, it takes the parts necessary for the factory, but not
those related to the management of the instantiated algorithms.

Recent versions of Gaudi use some functionality of ROOT called Reflex. We don't
want to take that route, so our factory is based on Andrei Alexandrescu's
pattern (which is similar to how Gaudi used to do it in versions prior to v19).

In Gaudi, there is an IAlgorithmFactory interface. At this time, I really can't
see the point of this and so I'm leaving it out, at least for the moment.

In another departure from Gaudi, the factory is implemented as a singleton.
