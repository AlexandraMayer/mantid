=============

We have decided to place the IProperty interface between INamedInterface & IAlgorithm.
This means that a pointer to IAlgorithm has access to the public interface of IProperty, 
which was not previously the case.

At present, only those methods that don't refer to the Property class (which we don't have
yet) are included.
