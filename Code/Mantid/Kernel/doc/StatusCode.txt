=============

This class is used as a return type in IAlgorithm, the first thing I'm implementing for
Mantid. Therefore, I've put in a minimal implementation of this. Basically just adding methods
as they are required by the other classes I'm importing.
We will decide later exactly what we want from this class.

WARNING: The constructor of the form StatusCode( unsigned long code, bool checked = false ) is
used to convert to a StatusCode object when a type of the form StatusCode::SUCCESS is returned
by a method.


I'm not at all sure that I like this class. It looks rather like a FORTRAN hangover to me, and that
what we should be using for this is exceptions. But on the other hand it's very heavily used, so
it may be just too much trouble to drop or completely change it.

I'm not sure it's a good idea to have the status set to 'success' by default - it leads to some
code in other classes that's confusing if you don't know this. I think it would be better to 
require that it be explicitly set.
