/** Calculates an approximation of the attenuation due to absorption and scattering in a 
    generic sample shape. The sample shape can be defined by, e.g., the CreateSampleShape
    algorithm. Note that the name of this algorithm is 'AbsorptionCorrection'.

    Properties:
    <UL>
    <LI> InputWorkspace  - The name of the input workspace. </LI>
    <LI> OutputWorkspace - The name of the output workspace. Can be the same as the input one. </LI>
    <LI> AttenuationXSection - The attenuation cross-section for the sample material in barns. </LI>
    <LI> ScatteringXSection - The scattering cross-section for the sample material in barns. </LI>
    <LI> SampleNumberDensity - The number density of the sample in Angstrom^-3.</LI>
    <LI> NumberOfWavelengthPoints - The number of wavelength points for which numerical integral is calculated (default: all points). </LI>
    <LI> ExpMethod - The method to calculate exponential function (Normal or Fast approximation). </LI>
    <LI> Emode  - The energy mode (0=elastic, 1=direct geometry, 2=indirect geometry) </LI>
    <LI> Efixed - Value of fixed energy: EI (emode=1) or EF (emode=2) (meV) </LI>
    <LI> ElementSize - The side dimension of an integration element cube in mm (default: 1). </LI>
    </UL>

    This algorithm uses numerical integration method to calculate attenuation factors
    resulting from absorption and single scattering in a sample with the material 
    properties given. Factors are calculated for each spectrum (i.e. detector position)
    and wavelength point, as defined by the input workspace. 
    The sample is first bounded by a cuboid, which is divided up into small cubes.
    The cubes whose centres lie within the sample make up the set of integration elements
    and path lengths through the sample are
    calculated for the centre-point of each element, and a numerical
    integration is carried out using these path lengths over the volume elements.

    This algorithm assumes that the beam comes along the Z axis
    and that the sample is at the origin.
